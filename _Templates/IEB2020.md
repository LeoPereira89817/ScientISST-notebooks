# Introdução à Engenharia Biomédica (IEB)
```Mestrado Integrado em Engenharia Biomédica``` | ```Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa``` | ```2020-2021```

## Description & Objectives

IEB ([Fenix page](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/IEB/2009-2010/1-semestre/pagina-inicial)) aims to introduce students to the structure of the course, presenting the arguments behind the current organization of this multi-disciplinary course.

- Contact with typical cases taken from the practice that will be analyzed together in order to stimulate the critical analysis of students and familiarize them with problems found in the practice of Biomedical Engineering, namely in the following areas: biomaterials, artificial organs, biotechnology, bioinformatics, computational biology , biomechanics, instrumentation, acquisition of physiological signals, diagnostic techniques.
  
- Analysis of a concrete problem (in small groups; for example: how to develop and consider a strategy to obtain a solution and outline its practical implementation).
  
- Student groups will be encouraged to use information sources from the Internet, in addition to others that will be distributed.

```Project-Based Learning (PBL)```, ```Active Learning```, ```m-learning```, ```Jupyter Notebooks```
