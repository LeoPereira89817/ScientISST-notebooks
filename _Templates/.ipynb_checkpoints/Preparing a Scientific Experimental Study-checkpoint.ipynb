    "\n",
    "Examples of exclusion criteria may be as common as excluding participants that present a specific characteristic, such as taking medication or having historical disorder that could interfere with the aim of the study, or by implementing more quantitative measures that draw a threshold to admit participants, such as using scales. For instance, if the latter study is aimed at studying ECG from healthy students, the researcher would likely decline a registration from a subject with a heart disease or under medication, despite them being a first year student, and whom practise competitive swimming.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### <div style=\"color:#00a0e4\">   2.5. How are you going to achieve the target sample? </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "It matters to consider carefully the characteristics of the population one aims to study, and the objectives that are defined. At this point, the difficulty of gathering a large population, or a small population with a particularly rare characteristic, should both be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for appropriate dissemination channels must be acknowledged. Best practices include propagation on social media, both in personal as in institutional pages. Another simple dissemination tool that works out well is distributing flyers about the study, stating its aim, target population and contact info. Our experience revealed that the word of mouth dissemination through previous participants remains as one of the most efficient ways to reach more potential participants. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case the sample has a very well defined profile, personal, clinical or socio-economical wise, it might be advisable to identify communities or enterprises that include large amounts of people with that profile. Hence the researchers must also plan a way to get the target population to conduct their study. One can figure out certain society groups prone to participate, and gather certain tools to reach them. If the population is targeted at healthy young volunteers, maybe the researchers can use all their academic network to spread the study and recruit volunteers. If the population is elderly, the researchers should brainstorm about possible places where they could reach potential participants in a easier way, either nursing homes, or churches. \n",
    "If the research objective is to comprise a group with a very well defined clinical profile, then it might make sense to establish a collaboration with a clinical institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite not being a mandatory procedure in biomedical research, rewards have been widely recognized as positive means to potentiate both participant's recruitment and their motivation during the activities of the procedures. |"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the process of participants recruitment should be as automatic and digital as possible. Online registration forms are the easier and more efficient way to have participants enrolled. Then, it is important to find a way to integrate these registrations in a tool that allows automatic access to the input data and deal with it in order to decide whether to include it in the study sample, and within each group. Google forms and consequent google sheets have worked out well for us. For instance, most of the studies aim at 50% female participants, for which it matters to automatically access if a new female registration is within or without the defined sample. Further info can be computed more easily using excel sheets, e.g. if the registration form comprised a scale whose punctuation will differentiate participants into several groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, in this case the pre-selection of the participants into each group was done using their HADS assessment and considering their age, reason for which the utilization of online excel sheets was the most efficient way of having this pre-selection computed in a fast and automatic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, once the participant enrolls in the study, the researcher must contact them and proceed with the scheduling of the experimental sessions. \n",
    "Several ways might be used to do so, having that personal e-mail contact remains the most used one. Regarding the scheduling process, researchers are increasingly adopting online scheduling options. The one we used was Doodle, which was a good option and that allowed the adjustment of certain parameters (such as choosing different slots for each day, or to allow the participant to choose one slot only). A good practise is to send e-mail reminders to the participants one day before their session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite all the efforts towards conducting a consistent and standardized study, some lapses or unforeseen events might and will, most likely, occur. We have adopted a Study LogBook, which is a simple but efficient method to keep track of the study. The logbook allows the researcher to register those simple unforeseen events that punctually occur in a given experiment, or simple notes regarding any parameter within it, such as the mood of participant or an acquisition problem.

    "The experimental protocol includes the sequence of events or experiences to follow during the experiment, which can have one or several versions. In fact, depending on the number of sessions, on the number of groups within the sample, or on the sample structure as priorly defined, the researcher might want to distinguish two or more versions of the sequence of experiences included in protocol.\n",

    "Afterwards, a number of steps and choices are taken to making the protocol reproducible and efficient, from the selection and gathering of all required materials, to the schedule constraints and the definition of the set of lab conditions that all sessions should comply with. The importance of these is to guarantee the most standardized procedures and uniform external conditions that could compromise the validity of the results of the study. For instance, in an emotion-elicitation protocol, external audio or visual influence should be avoided. Similarly, in a study involving facial images recording, the lab conditions with respect to light must be within certain parameters and as similar as possible across sessions. "

    "First, you should decide if the entire dataset is to go public, or if a specific content should have restricted access (such as video footage or anything that may compromise the privacy of the user). You can even restrict access to the entire dataset, still, you should leave the metadata public. Metadata is fundamental in data sharing since it contains contextual information of the data, its purpose, the experimental protocol, and even associated contents to help on data analysis. Besides metadata, it is also important to have associated a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). \n",
